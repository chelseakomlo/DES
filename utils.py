# How to generate sub keys for each permutation? 

# In cryptography, the so-called product ciphers are a certain kind of ciphers, where the (de-)ciphering of data is done in "rounds". 
# A key schedule is an algorithm that, given the key, calculates the subkeys for these rounds.

# DES uses a key schedule where the 56 bit key is divided into two 28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately. 
# In successive rounds, both halves are rotated left by one or two bits (specified for each round), and then 48 subkey bits are 
# selected by Permuted Choice 2 (PC-2) â€” 24 bits from the left half, and 24 from the right. The rotations mean that a different 
# set of bits is used in each subkey; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys.
