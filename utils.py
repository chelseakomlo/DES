# initial permutation IP
# The Initial Permuation (IP) is a description of how a byte wide interface is connected 
# to a 64 bit block comprised of two 32 bit blocks (L and R). 
# Consider a byte wide interface with the bits numbered 1-8. 
# The event numbered bits go to the L Block and the odd numbered bits go to the R block. 
# Note that the bit order is big endian, where bit 1 is most significant and bit 8 is least 
# significant. The input block is typically loaded as 8 successive byte loads

KEY = "12345" 
# 1. How to choose a key? 

# The key is and must be picked at random. You grab a bunch of bits from wherever, and hope that they are random enough to resist 
# attacks on the key generation algorithm.

# DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, which means that to decrypt the data you must have the same key that was used to encrypt it. 


# 2. What is the proper key for this? 

# At the simplest level, the key is generated from a hashed version of a password. The key (ie the specific series of bits) must 
# be re-creatable otherwise you will not be able to decrypt the encrypted object.

# DES keys must either be 56 or 48 bits

# 3. How to generate sub keys for each permutation? 

# In cryptography, the so-called product ciphers are a certain kind of ciphers, where the (de-)ciphering of data is done in "rounds". 
# The general setup of each round is the same, except for some hard-coded parameters and a part of the cipher key, called a subkey. 
# A key schedule is an algorithm that, given the key, calculates the subkeys for these rounds.

# DES uses a key schedule where the 56 bit key is divided into two 28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately. 
# In successive rounds, both halves are rotated left by one or two bits (specified for each round), and then 48 subkey bits are 
# selected by Permuted Choice 2 (PC-2) â€” 24 bits from the left half, and 24 from the right. The rotations mean that a different 
# set of bits is used in each subkey; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys.
